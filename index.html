        <p>
          I choose facebook because it has so much to use and its design is very
          customized. very modern design and facebook can be used a lot besides
          talking to our friends and we can also use facebook in our businesses.

          <img src="./Assets/github.png" alt="Github" />
        </a>
        <p>
          I choose github because of the great value of its use as a programmer
          because you can put your files while it is being replaced before you
          save it and you can first think if you did it right and you can upload
          your important files on it that can help your portfolio as a website
          developer or programmer.

        </a>
        <p>
          I choose instagram because of its minamalistic design and absolutely
          its novice users will not be misled by how they are create an account
          or on how they login account.very much modern of its design and very
          clean you will never get lost in using it.

          <img src="./Assets/linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn" />
        </a>
        <p>
          I choose linkedin because its use as a developer is very important
          where you can build a professional profile as a website developer or
          whatever you want and you can also show here the previous projects
          that you have done as a programmer.

        </a>
        <p>
          I choose twitter because it is very modern and friendly to use. on the
          login page you will never get lost in using it because you will
          immediately see how to login or create an account and the design is
          laso very clean.
